                  <p><strong>Numbers 11:9-10
                  (KJV); </strong>And when the
                  dew fell upon the camp in the
                  night, the manna fell upon it.
                  Then Moses heard the people
                  weep throughout their families,
                  every man in the door of his
                  tent: and the anger of the Lord
                  was kindled greatly; Moses
                  also was displeased.</p><p>--
                  <br /> <br />During their
                  journey through the wilderness,
                  the children of Israel were fed
                  with manna from heaven. It
                  came freely without any effort
                  either by planting or digging.
                  <br /> <br />In time, they
                  started to grumble and
                  complain about God&rsquo;s
                  choice of food for them. In
                  Numbers 11:13, the Bible
                  reveals that they wanted a
                  change and demanded meat.
                  <br /> <br />Was there
                  anything wrong with the
                  manna? Of course not.<br />
                  <br />This attitude of the
                  children of Israel is not unlike
                  that of some Christians today.
                  <br /> <br />Manna in this
                  context represents the Word of
                  God. Today, we have believers
                  who take issue with
                  &lsquo;manna&rsquo; and start
                  grumbling about its ability to
                  sustain them. They have eaten
                  it daily and are wondering why
                  their lives are not changing.
                  They have listened to different
                  sermons but their
                  circumstances are not getting
                  better.<br /> <br />Ultimately,
                  they start to blame the
                  message. They make
                  statements such as
                  &lsquo;maybe this message is
                  not for me.&rsquo; They say,
                  &lsquo; I need something
                  &lsquo;deeper&rsquo;, I need
                  meat.&rsquo;<br /> <br />You
                  should not blame manna when
                  you have not yet understood
                  what it is (Exodus 16:15).
                  Instead of blaming the
                  message, seek to understand
                  what You have received thus
                  far. The message in its purity
                  has the answers you need. The
                  question you must ask is,
                  &lsquo;have I really
                  understood?&rsquo;<br /> <br
                  />Praise the Lord!<br /> <br />

                of stripes, shall be beaten with
                few stripes. For unto
                whomsoever much is given, of
                him shall be much required:
                and to whom men have
                committed much, of him they
                will ask the more.<br /> <br />--
                <br /> <br />In this
                dispensation, God has availed
                knowledge to His church in
                abundance. We are living in
                times where revelation is more
                available than it has ever been.
                <br /> <br />We are humbled
                by the fact that God has made
                certain portals in the realm of
                spirits accessible for us to
                delve into greater depths than
                the previous generations.<br />
                <br />But how come the
                knowledge that we have does
                not equate to the power of God
                functioning in our days? Why is
                it that the men and women of
                old who knew less than us
                demonstrated the power of
                God to a greater degree than
                we do today?<br /> <br />One
                of the reasons for this state of
                affairs is the fact that our
                people today do not know what
                they know. They have received
                the mysteries of the kingdom
                but they do not understand
                what power comes with those
                very mysteries.<br /> <br
                />When you hear the great
                truths of the Bible preached in
                our day, what comes to your
                spirit? Are you merely excited
                or do you really set your heart
                to know what you know?<br />
                <br />One wise man once said
                that to know and not to do is
                not to know. If you cannot
                demonstrate what you know
                then you do not know it.<br />
                <br />This knowledge has a
                price tag and that price is spelt
                out in our theme scripture.
                Serve God with what you know
                by stepping out in the boldness
                of faith; exercise yourself in the
                liberties of the Spirit because
                they are your portion in Christ.

                (KJV); </strong>For as many
                of you as have been baptized
                into Christ have put on Christ.
                There is neither Jew nor
                Greek, there is neither bond
                nor free, there is neither male
                nor female: for ye are all one in
                Christ Jesus.<br /><br />--<br
                /><br />Assignments in the
                kingdom of God are not
                gender-based. God can use a
                woman as mightily as He can
                use a man. He can anoint a
                woman as greatly as He can
                anoint a man.<br /><br />It is
                unfortunate that many women
                have fallen prey to certain
                stereotypes. Some have
                misunderstood the heart of
                God in 1 Peter 3:7. When the
                Bible refers to her as the
                weaker vessel, it is only in light
                of physical weakness. It does
                not mean that she is weak in
                the spirit.<br /><br />In the
                mind of God, there is more to
                the woman than her domestic
                role; there is more to her than
                being a mother or a wife. The
                potential to define nations lies
                in a woman.<br /><br />In
                Genesis 25:23, the Lord
                appeared to Rebekah and told
                her, &ldquo;Two nations are in
                thy womb&hellip;&rdquo; In the
                man, it was merely a seed, in
                the woman, the seed became
                nations!<br /><br />God is
                calling upon the women of our
                generation to look beyond the
                limitations that have been
                placed on them by society,
                culture or religion. The nations
                are calling and the answer is in
                you, woman.<br /><br />More
                than ever, the women of our
                generation should understand
                that their greatest emancipation
                is hinged on their liberty to
                seek God. With Him, there is

                    you&rsquo;re serious about
                    living this new resurrection life
                    with Christ, act like it.</p><p>--
                    </p><p>The men who live by a
                    false light have often
                    demonstrated extremes in the
                    lengths to which they will go to
                    prove their faith in their
                    &lsquo;gods&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p>One such extreme is
                    shown through a story of a
                    battle in 2 Kings 3:25-27.</p>
                    <p>The Bible says,
                    &ldquo;And when the king of
                    Moab saw that the battle was
                    too sore for him, he took with
                    him seven hundred men that
                    drew swords, to break through
                    even unto the king of Edom:
                    but they could not. Then he
                    took his eldest son that should
                    have reigned in his stead, and
                    offered him for a burnt offering
                    upon the wall. And there was
                    great indignation against Israel:
                    and they departed from him,
                    and returned to their own
                    land.&rdquo;</p><p>This
                    battle was won, not because of
                    the might of a man&rsquo;s
                    army but because he went over
                    and beyond the bounds of
                    human sanity in order to win.
                    He sacrificed his eldest son,
                    heir to his throne.</p><p>Men
                    whose allegiance is to the
                    powers of darkness often go to
                    unimaginable lengths to move
                    their &lsquo;god.&rsquo;</p>
                    <p>How can a Christian who
                    cannot fast for more than three
                    hours compare to such a man?
                    How can a believer who will not
                    pray because she has a
                    headache compare to such a
                    person?</p><p>God does not
                    expect you to kill your child to
                    move heaven but He definitely
                    requires us to shake off the
                    mediocrity with which we
                    approach spiritual things and
                    move heaven through the
                    boldest acts of faith!</p><p>If
                    you must start a crazy fast, do
                    it. If you must launch into a
                    crazier life of prayer, then do it.
                    If you must spend yourself like
                    you have never done before
                    until people question your
                    sanity, do it!</p><p>Hallelujah!

                    living this new resurrection life
                    with Christ, act like it.<br /><br
                    />--<br /><br />It is unfortunate
                    that today, we are increasingly
                    witnessing a lazy approach to
                    the life of Christianity.<br /><br
                    />We have believers who pray
                    when they feel like it, fast when
                    they wish to, give only as led
                    by their feelings and
                    evangelise only when
                    reminded to.<br /><br />Some
                    have no regard for spiritual
                    things. If the enemy attacks
                    them, they accept it meekly as
                    their lot in life. This is evident in
                    how they deal with the devil;
                    they can never stand up tall as
                    men and women of authority
                    and command him to take his
                    hands off what is theirs. If they
                    meet a sick person, they do not
                    have the courage or faith to
                    pray for such a person.<br />
                    <br />As such, many Christians
                    profess to know a God whose
                    power they can never
                    demonstrate. In fact, there
                    seems to be no difference
                    between a believer and an
                    atheist.<br /><br />Is this
                    God&rsquo;s desire for His
                    children? Of course not!<br />
                    <br />Who is a Christian? Who
                    is a tongue speaking child of
                    God? What kind of life does a
                    man filled with the Spirit of God
                    live? Christianity was birthed in
                    power, has been preserved by
                    power and will continue to
                    stand by this same power.<br
                    /><br />God demands greater
                    zeal, tenacity, commitment and
                    daring from us as His children.
                    You must live the kind of life
                    that causes those around you
                    to acknowledge the fact that
                    you are not ordinary. Refuse to
                    be normal! Be deliberate in
                    stepping out in faith and the
                    boldness of the Spirit because
                    God lives in you.<br /><br

                  </strong>And Jesus answered
                  and said unto it, No man eat
                  fruit of thee hereafter for ever.
                  And his disciples heard it.</p>
                  <p>--</p><p>Our theme
                  scripture teaches us that Jesus
                  <strong>ANSWERED</strong>
                  the fig tree, presupposing that
                  it must have said something to
                  Him.</p><p>The question then
                  to the student of the Spirit is,
                  what did the tree say?</p>
                  <p>This tree looked upon
                  Jesus and regarded Him as a
                  mere man who is subject to the
                  seasons and times of the earth.
                  In essence, it assured Him that
                  as a mortal man, He had to
                  wait like all other fallen men do
                  for the season when fruit would
                  appear on its branches.</p>
                  <p>This was an insult to God
                  in the flesh; the incorruptible
                  one who knew no sin and as
                  such was not subject to the
                  laws of the fallen world. In
                  response, He cursed it.</p>
                  <p>As a new creature in Christ,
                  you have put on Christ and
                  bear His identity in all things.
                  Nothing created has a right to
                  subject you to the laws of fallen
                  men.</p><p>By this portion of
                  scripture, God has given you
                  the authority to command
                  provision from things
                  regardless of their earthly
                  seasons. Your testimony is as
                  declared in Job 22:29,
                  &ldquo;When men are cast
                  down, then thou shalt say,
                  there is lifting
                  up&hellip;.&rdquo; When it is
                  an earthly season of lack, you
                  command abundance.</p>

                  disabuses us of the notion that

                  <p><strong>Psalm 110:3
                  (KJV); </strong>Thy people
                  shall be willing in the day of thy
                  power, in the beauties of
                  holiness from the womb of the
                  morning: thou hast the dew of
                  thy youth.<br /><br />--<br />
                  <br />God has designed the
                  world to respond to any man
                  who has power with men. With
                  this kind of power, the earth will
                  yield its goodness to you and
                  the world will bring its treasures
                  into your bosom.<br /><br
                  />The Amplified version of our
                  theme scripture explains the
                  nature of this power more
                  clearly. It says, &ldquo;Your
                  people will offer themselves
                  willingly in the day of your
                  power&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br
                  />Power with men is not
                  achieved through manipulation,
                  threats, and dictatorship. It
                  comes to those that have
                  learnt to serve and meet the
                  needs of many.<br /><br />For
                  example, there are businesses
                  in this world that serve the
                  needs of billions of people. As
                  such, even their revenues
                  correspond to the number of
                  people they serve. That is a
                  form of power with men.<br />
                  <br />The owners of such
                  businesses do not have to
                  worry about where they will
                  sleep or find their next meal. As
                  they provide answers to
                  multitudes, it goes without
                  saying that their needs are also
                  met.<br /><br />This principle
                  works in ministry, in career,
                  and in many other aspects of
                  life.<br /><br />By this wisdom,
                  may God position you as an
                  answer to the world.<br /><br
                  />Hallelujah!<br /><br />

                  is as if there were a burning fire
                  shut up in my bones. And I am
                  weary of enduring and holding
                  it in; I cannot [contain it any
                  longer].<br /> <br />--<br /> <br
                  />The Word of God, by its very
                  nature, cannot sit passively in
                  the spirit of a man. It always
                  provokes action because it
                  seeks to produce fruit and
                  results.<br /> <br />The
                  prophet Jeremiah explained his
                  own experience with the Word
                  and said that it was as a fire in
                  his bones, he could not hold it
                  in.<br /> <br />The ultimate
                  question to the child of God is;
                  by what fire are you burning?
                  <br /> <br />If the fire in you
                  cannot provoke you to preach
                  the gospel and reach out to lost
                  souls, by what fire are you
                  burning?<br /> <br />If the fire
                  in you cannot cause you to
                  serve, to give of your time in
                  the cause of advancing the
                  gospel, by what fire are you
                  burning?<br /> <br />If the fire
                  in you will not lead you to pray
                  and intercede for the saints
                  and the Church of Christ, by
                  what fire are you burning?<br
                  /> <br />In Acts 4:20, Peter and
                  John had this to say about this
                  fire, "For we cannot but speak
                  of what we have seen and
                  heard."<br /> <br />When

               <p><strong>1 Corinthians 9:18
               (KJV); </strong>What is my
               reward then? Verily that, when
               I preach the gospel, I may
               make the gospel of Christ
               without charge, that I abuse not
               my power in the gospel.</p>
               <p>--</p><p>The gospel has
               to be preached without a
               charge. Paul warns us that
               when you put a price tag to the
               message, you abuse your
               power in the gospel.</p>
               <p>What power does he refer
               to in this instance?</p><p>Is
               this the power to make a lame
               man walk? The power to open
               a blind eye? The power to heal
               cancer?</p><p>No, this is not
               the kind of power Paul means.
               A man does not lose his ability
               to demonstrate the Spirit of
               God through signs, miracles,
               and wonders simply because
               he demands that people pay
               for those miracles.</p><p>A
               prophet does not lose his gift
               simply because he demands
               that a man give him a seed in
               exchange for divine oracles.
               </p><p>The power that is
               abused in this instance is much
               more important and significant
               and it is the power over men.
               This is the power in Psalm
               110:3 wherein the Bible says,
               &ldquo;Thy people shall be
               willing in the day of thy
               power.&rdquo;</p><p>When a
               minister charges for the gospel
               or ministers the gifts of God at
               a price, he also loses his place
               in God that allows him to
               command people&rsquo;s
               destinies; that place that

               means that in this life, there is
               nothing more accurate than the
               scriptures.</p><p>The Greek
               word used for 'sure word' is
               'bebaios' which is translated to
               mean, firm, steadfast,
               enduring, and certain. This

               <br /><br />Sometimes, life's
               misery is caused by the many
               opinions we seek outside the
               Word of God.<br /><br />For
               example, a prophet who is not
               fully aligned to the will of God
               may reveal that the disease
               you are suffering from may kill
               you in three years' time
               because that is what he sees
               in the realm of spirits.<br /><br
               />But what does the Word of
               God see?<br /><br />It sees
               you healthy in old age because
               it says, "With long life will I
               satisfy him, and shew him my
               salvation."(Psalm 91:16). This
               is the most accurate account of

               relatives may have an opinion
               based on the circumstances
               you are going through. By
               these, they may judge you as
               disqualified from success.<br

                  theme scripture, it is clear that
                  the Lord desires that 'all men
                  see.'<br /><br />As a minister
                  of the gospel, never build a

                God elevates you, you must
                always remember that wisdom
                is also on the streets and you
                will always need it.</p>
                <p>What does this mean?</p>
                <p>When some people are
                promoted, everyone below
                them on the social or status
                ladder loses significance. They
                change how they talk to and
                treat 'lesser mortals.'</p>
                <p>That is not how our Lord
                and Master lived. He was God
                in flesh but He interacted most
                with the outcasts and the
                disadvantaged men and
                women of His day.</p><p>His
                social circle came into question
                in Matthew 9:11(NLT) when
                the Pharisees asked, "Why
                does your teacher eat with
                such scum?"</p><p>No matter
                how great you are, even the
                seemingly least significant
                person may have something to
                teach you about life; it may be
                your janitor, house help, the
                man at the newspaper stand or
                the vendor across the street.
                </p><p>Remain humble, there

                  <p>In yesterday's devotion, we
                  understood the importance of
                  waiting on God for His full
                  counsel; it is not enough to
                  hear a single instruction and
                  run off to execute it without
                  understanding from the Lord

                  draw a fundamental lesson
                  from the apostle Paul on the
                  effect of building a ministry, a
                  relationship, business or career
                  on incomplete counsel.</p>
                  <p>We learn that where
                  counsel is not complete, there
                  is a form of death. (Death in
                  this instance is represented by
                  blood).</p><p>There are
                  ministries (and other aspects of
                  people's lives) dying because
                  when some men and women of
                  God heard the instruction of
                  God, they did not wait for His
                  full counsel.</p><p>Child of
                  God, I urge you to reflect and
                  think back on some of the
                  instructions you received from
                  God. Did you hear all He had to
                  say?</p><p>Because of the
                  difficulties you are facing, you
                  may be wondering if God
                  indeed spoke to you or whether
                  you heard Him right.</p>
                  <p>Possibly, the reason you
                  are stranded and struggling is
                  because you only received
                  partial counsel. </p>
                  <p>Retrace your steps and
                  seek God's face once again.
                  Wait on Him to expound on
                  what more you needed to hear.

                 God to be found in trivial fights
                 against a fellow believer. This
                 is because their judgement of
                 matters is sound as it springs

                   the appearing of Jesus Christ:
                   <br /><br />--<br /><br />God
                   values the trial of your faith. He
                   says it is much more precious
                   than gold.<br /><br />Some
                   Christians wish to live in a
                   world where their faith is never
                   subjected to fire.<br /><br
                   />They want to sail through life
                   with no hiccups to upset their
                   perfect existence.<br /><br />If
                   that is the version of
                   Christianity you ascribe to, I
                   assure you it is not the one our
                   Lord and Saviour died for.<br
                   /><br />In John 16:33, He
                   says, "These things I have
                   spoken unto you, that in me ye
                   might have peace. In the world
                   ye shall have tribulation: but be
                   of good cheer; I have
                   overcome the world."<br /><br
                   />In Mark 10:30, He says, "But
                   he shall receive an hundredfold
                   now in this time, houses, and
                   brethren, and sisters, and
                   mothers, and children, and
                   lands, with PERSECUTIONS;
                   and in the world to come
                   eternal life."<br /><br />At
                   every stage of your life, your
                   faith will be tried because this
                   trial is a cornerstone in the
                   patterns of divine consecration
                   and the basis of qualification
                   for your elevation in God.<br />

                   time(kairos) cannot be
                   overstated. Sometimes, it is
                   even a matter of life and death.
                   </p><p>Events are framed in
                   kairos before they are
                   manifested in chronos(physical
                   time).</p><p>What this means
                   is that things first happen in the
                   spiritual realm before they do
                   in the physical realm.</p><p>A
                   man may get involved in an
                   accident on the 25th of May.
                   However, spiritually, this
                   accident did not happen on the
                   25th, it happened three months

                   the Bible says that a prudent
                   man foresees evil, it means
                   that he is attuned to spiritual
                   time. This man is able to see
                   the accident three months
                   before and deal with it before it
                   manifests in the physical realm.
                   </p><p>The woman in
                   question, if prudent, is able to
                   identify the disease six weeks
                   prior and curse it from its root
                   before it shows up under a

                  miracle that was summarised
                  in these terms, "Since the
                  world began was it not heard

                 the honour of kings is to search
                 out a matter.<br /><br />--<br
                 /><br />The Bible teaches us
                 that there is great glory in
                 searching out matters. Men of
                 deep and deliberate study
                 attract honour.<br /><br />This
                 means that a man who has a
                 slave mindset is not given to
                 study. It is the enslaved who
                 take everything at face value
                 and never dig deep into facts
                 and ideas when presented to
                 them.<br /><br />It is the
                 enslaved from whom you hide
                 things by putting them in a
                 book.<br /><br />I have taken
                 time to study men and women
                 of great success in life. One
                 thing is common to them; they
                 study. These are people who
                 have risen to the heights of
                 their industries on the wings of
                 accumulated knowledge.<br />
                 <br />If it is their field of
                 expertise, they will endeavour
                 to learn everything about it.<br
                 /><br />You cannot be a car
                 salesman who knows little
                 about cars. You cannot be a
                 sportsman with minimal
                 knowledge about your sport or
                 a banker who does not
                 understand your business.<br
                 /><br />As a child of God who
                 wishes to succeed in life, you
                 must expose your mind to
                 greater insights about the world
                 or its systems. You must study
                 God's Word intently as the

              (KJV); </strong>After this I
              looked, and, behold, a door
              was opened in heaven: and the
              first voice which I heard was as
              it were of a trumpet talking with
              me; which said, Come up
              hither, and I will shew thee
              things which must be
              hereafter.&rdquo;</p><p>--
              </p><p>History as we know it
              has lived through a progression
              of world views.</p><p>At some
              point in time, the predominant
              view of the world and life was
              mythological. Every change in
              nature was the result of some
              mystical being.</p><p>Then
              came the natural philosophers
              who were concerned with the
              natural world and its
              processes.</p><p>Over time,
              various world views emerged.
              These may be attitudinal,
              ideological, religious or
              philosophical.</p><p>The
              children of this world have built
              everything you see and know
              based on how they view the
              world.</p><p>The fundamental
              question to the child of God is,
              "from where are you seeing the
              world?"</p><p>When God
              says come up hither, He is
              inviting us to His view because
              He has an opinion on
              everything that man has built
              and designed.</p><p>He
              knows what will stand the test
              of time and what will be
              washed away by the tides of
              time; He knows what has been
              built on a sandy foundation and
              what will stand as a fortress
              through history.</p><p>If you
              are going to be a part of the
              change equation, you have to
              see the world God's way. He is
              viewing it from the vantage
              point of eternity not history
              alone.</p><p>Come up hither
              is Him saying, see as I see and
              when you do, you will know
              what must be shaken to the
              ground and what will stand.

                   (KJV); </strong>Wherefore I
                   will not be negligent to put you
                   always in remembrance of
                   these things, though ye know
                   them, and be established in the
                   present truth<br /><br />--<br
                   /><br />As a child of God who
                   has been in church circles for a
                   while, there are things I am
                   certain you have heard over
                   and over again.<br /><br
                   />Today, I ask you,
                   &lsquo;How do you treat
                   repeated truth even if you
                   already know it?&rdquo;<br />
                   <br />Some people have an
                   entirely wrong attitude to truths
                   they assume they have heard
                   too much of. The moment a
                   minister starts to teach such,
                   they switch off because they
                   have heard it all before.<br />
                   <br />What a tragedy, child of
                   God.<br /><br />Allow me to
                   explain this from a scientific
                   perspective because science
                   often teaches wisdom we
                   should also respect.<br /><br
                   />Studies have shown that the
                   brain forms new pathways
                   when certain things are
                   repeated and as such, one is
                   able to optimise performance
                   and retain knowledge longer.
                   <br /><br />Our theme
                   scripture teaches us that God
                   too respects the power of
                   repetition.What science calls
                   new pathways in the brain is
                   what the man of wisdom in
                   Proverbs 3:20 calls depths
                   breaking by knowledge. To us,
                   each repetition brings more
                   knowledge.<br /><br />God will
                   allow His ministers to teach
                   you certain truths several times
                   because each repetition in fact
                   plunges you deeper into truth.
                   <br /><br />Don&rsquo;t yawn
                   mentally with a here-we-go-
                   again sigh. Open your spirit
                   because God is ready to
                   deepen your roots.<br /><br

                 (KJV); </strong>Now the
                 LORD had said unto Abram,
                 Get thee out of thy country, and
                 from thy kindred, and from thy
                 father's house, unto a land that
                 I will shew thee:</p><p>--</p>
                 <p>When God told Abraham to
                 leave the home he had known
                 for years for a land the Lord
                 would show him, God did not
                 give him specifics.</p>
                 <p>Some people assume that
                 God's leading to Abraham
                 would have sounded like
                 "travel forty kilometres to the
                 north, turn left, climb up the
                 mountain, descend into the
                 valley, and turn right, there you
                 will find the land I prepared for
                 you."</p><p>While there are
                 instances where He may direct
                 a man in this manner, this is
                 not the case a lot of the time.
                 </p><p>When God is dealing
                 with men of faith, He knows
                 that the GPS is internal and
                 Spirit-led. Such a man will
                 know at what precise point to
                 turn left, move up the mountain
                 or slope down into the valley.
                 </p><p>This was Abraham's
                 experience in Genesis 22.
                 Once again, God did not give
                 him specifics. The Bible says in
                 verse 2, "And he said, Take
                 now thy son, thine only son
                 Isaac, whom thou lovest, and
                 get thee into the land of
                 Moriah; and offer him there for
                 a burnt offering upon one of the
                 mountains which I will tell thee
                 of."</p><p>In Genesis 22:4,
                 the scriptures say, "Then on
                 the third day Abraham lifted up
                 his eyes, and saw the place

                 <p><strong>Psalm 29:3-
                 5(KJV); </strong>The voice of
                 the Lord is upon the waters: the
                 God of glory thundereth: the
                 Lord is upon many waters. The
                 voice of the Lord is powerful;
                 the voice of the Lord is full of
                 majesty. The voice of the Lord
                 breaketh the cedars; yea, the
                 Lord breaketh the cedars of
                 Lebanon.</p><p>--</p><p>In
                 this life, you may suffer many
                 losses.<br /> <br />But
                 regardless of what you lose, if
                 you can still hear the voice of
                 God, you will rise from the
                 ashes of any failure.<br /> <br
                 />The voice of God will help
                 you rebuild anything you have
                 lost. It is men that are dead to
                 His voice who struggle
                 endlessly to rise again once
                 they fall.<br /> <br />In your
                 darkest moments, when
                 mystery clouds the future, seek
                 His voice.<br /> <br />Some
                 people focus too much on their
                 troubles or the injustices they
                 may have suffered. They
                 question God's love for them
                 and if He ever cared.<br /> <br
                 />That, child of God, is looking
                 at the wrong thing.<br /> <br
                 />In Psalm 32:8, comes the
                 blessed assurance. "I will
                 instruct you and teach you in
                 the way you should go; I will
                 counsel you with my eye upon
                 you."<br /> <br />His voice is
                 available to direct the steps of
                 your destiny, to lift you above
                 your mistakes, to give you the
                 kind of foundation that cannot
                 be shaken, to remind you that
                 He is still in the picture and
                 ready to restore all that has
                 ever been lost.<br /> <br
