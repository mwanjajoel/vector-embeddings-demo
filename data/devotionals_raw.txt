\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 \cb4 2 Samuel 11:1 (KJV); And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah.

\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 \cb4 When the Bible makes reference to Syrians, it is not just to a people in the Bible who were predominantly enemies of Israel. It is a spirit.
\fs24 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 \cb4 When you study the events that precede our theme scripture, you will notice that King David had won a victory against the Syrians. The Bible says in 2 Samuel 10:18, \'93And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach, the captain of their host, who died there.\'94
\fs24 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 \cb4 Our theme scripture follows this victory.
\fs24 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 \cb4 As a student of spiritual things, you must understand that the Syrian spirit usually diverts children of God from divine purpose following moments of victory.\'a0 In this instance, David chose to stay behind in the time when Kings go for war.\'a0
\fs24 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 \cb4 In our present day, this is the same spirit that will tell the Christian that she no longer needs to pray now that she has a very good job; she does not need to spend time in fellowship with God now that she had the child or spouse she had long desired; she does not need to seek God now that she has been elevated in social status.
\fs24 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 \cb4 Every victory must lead us into deeper intimacy with God. It must cement our commitment to divine purpose. It should make us more alert and aware of spiritual things. That is the mindset of the Christian who keeps his course and finishes well.

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 UNMASKING THE SPIRIT OF POVERTY: WASTEFULNESS
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 A man struggling with the spirit of poverty often wastes what is valuable to another man.
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 This wastefulness manifests itself in many, sometimes, small and seemingly insignificant ways.
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 Take the example of a young man who has been trusted with a laptop at his workplace. During the course of his work, he sits with a hot cup of coffee next to the laptop, unmindful of the fact that it may spill and damage company property. When it does, destroying components of the motherboard, he is more than eager to put in a requisition for a new laptop because the cost is not coming out of his pocket. That is a man given to wastefulness and as such, a poor spirit.
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 How about mindlessly contributing to the high operational expenses of your company? Why not turn off the lights and switch off machines such as printers and desktops so that they are not running through the night and creating an exorbitant electricity bill for your employer?\'a0
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 Some people do not give a hoot, as long as their salaries are paid in time. Whether operational costs are shooting through the roof or not is their employer's problem, not theirs. That is a man given to wastefulness, a poor man.
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 You cannot expect to rise above poverty with such an attitude towards what another man values. People with this weakness are struggling financially in some way. If not at the moment, then it is merely a matter of time, the jaws of poverty will open wide enough to swallow them up. Examine your life against this truth.

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 One of the attributes of a slothful spirit is that it only works under convenient circumstances. A lazy man can never work at times and in places where he feels inconvenienced.
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 As a young man growing up and learning how life works, one of my first bosses taught me a fundamental lesson; that I should never use rain as an excuse for turning up late or not showing up for an assignment.\'a0

\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 The God we serve completes what He starts. The Bible calls Him the author and finisher (Hebrews 12:2). Imagine for a moment where humanity would be if Jesus, midway His assignment had thrown in the towel because some Pharisee called Him Beelzebul. Imagine if He had told the Father to take the cup of suffering from Him and never added the infamous line, \'91nevertheless not my will but thine be done\'92 (Luke 22:42).

\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 A long time ago, I examined my life and realised that I did not have much to show for the many years that I had spent in employment.
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 I went to work every week, served my employer diligently and did what I had to do to get things done. However, I could not point to much and testify that this was an addition to my life.
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 I have known people who after the last day of their work with a certain employer will leave with nothing but that last month's salary after many years of labour.
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 During that time of my life, my biological father approached me and said something extremely fundamental and which set me on a course of self-examination and inquiry. He said, in our local dialect, \'91My son, I hope you are not struggling with the spirit of slavery.\'92

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 Slavery is a mindset that will always limit how far one progresses in life. Boundaries will always exist to define the scope of a slave\'92s success and increase in life.

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 Slavery creates the mindset that one\'92s primary source of provision is their job, business or if one is a minister, then the offertory bag. Slavery looks at the insufficiencies of the self to define the extent of one\'92s growth.

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 That is not what God wills for you as His child. He says you are a son and not a slave. It means that there must be a mindset shift. Sons have an abundance mentality. Sons do not look to their jobs as their source because they know that no employer can ever pay them enough. Sons define wealth not by their wages but by the inheritance they have in Christ.

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 John 11:1-4(KJV); Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 When our Lord said that Lazarus' sickness would not end in death, He meant what He said.

\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 When Lazarus died (John 11:11-13), Jesus did not waver in His faith. Lazarus sickness would not end in death!

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 How many times do Christians compromise by finding reasons for the failure of their faith? How often do they draw back because it is 'too late?'

\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 God wants to build you up into the kind of Christian who does not draw back merely because the situation has worsened. If you said 'Lazarus' sickness will not end in death\'92, it does not end in death!

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 Exercise your spirit to become stronger when circumstances worsen. Learn to fight back from the hardest situations.\'a0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 Don't give in to the enemy because God has not showed up yet. Do not cave in because the heat of the furnace has been doubled.\'a0 Do not lose faith because the flood waters have risen higher above your head. Believe to the end!

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 PRAYER: Loving Father, I thank You for this knowledge. Thank You for the tenacity of my spirit; the inner strength that makes me endure all manner of circumstances. I am not the kind that draws back because I know who is in me. I am a fighter, a warrior of Christ and a champion of faith, in Jesus' name, Amen.

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 Ecclesiastes 10:10(KJV); If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 In life, there are people whose results never equate to their labours.
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 Our theme scripture says that they have to invest more strength in what they do because the iron is blunt.

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 They pray very hard but see little or no fruit for their prayers.
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 They toil tirelessly at their jobs, projects and ministry but the amount of time and effort invested in the work is not proportionate to the results they receive.
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 Some of these individuals assume that the answer is to apply more strength; pray more, fast longer or work harder.\'a0
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 All of these are useless if one does not whet the edge of the iron.
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 Sometimes, the answer is not more prayer or more labour. Somethings are not in the prayer realm.\'a0
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 Every time you find that your efforts do not match up to your results, seek wisdom. She will direct you in places where strength has no say. She will have a voice in the realms where prayer has little impact.

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf0 PRAYER: Father, I thank You for the priceless gift of wisdom. She shows me the way and lights my path. I know how to seek her and find her. When she cries out, I heat and heed to her voice. My work is never in vain because wisdom gives me the ultimate direction, in Jesus' name, Amen.
